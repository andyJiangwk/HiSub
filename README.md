# SubHier
`SubHier` is a Python package aiming to construct the subhalo hierarchy numerically.

## Features
- Calculating the peak mass function(PMF) of subhalos of any level through self-convolution.
- Deriving the hierarchical origins of subhalos based on their levels, including the accretion rate, the initial merger ratio
  the accretion redshift distribution. (Developing)
## Preruquisite
`SubHier` relies only on several basic Python modules for scientific calculation:  `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`. They are built-in modules in most cases.
