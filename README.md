# HiSub
`HiSub` is a Python package aiming to construct the subhalo hierarchy numerically. The related paper can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20181. 

## Features
- Calculating the peak mass function(PMF) of subhalos of any level through self-convolution.
- (Developing) Deriving the hierarchical origins of subhalos based on their levels, including the accretion rate, the initial merger ratio
  the accretion redshift distribution. 
## Preruquisite
`HiSub` relies solely on several fundamental Python modules for scientific computing:  `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`, `matplotlib`.

## Examples
