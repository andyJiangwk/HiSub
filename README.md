# HiSub: Unveiling Self-Similarity in Subhalo Hierarchy
`HiSub` is a Python package aiming to construct the subhalo hierarchy numerically. The related paper can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20181. 

## Features
- Calculating the peak mass function(PMF) of subhalos of any level through self-convolution.
- Deriving the hierarchical origins of subhalos based on their levels, including the accretion rate, the initial merger ratio
  , the accretion redshift distribution. 
## Prerequisite
`HiSub` relies on several fundamental Python modules for scientific computing:  `numpy`, `scipy`, `math`, `matplotlib`. Additionally, the Python package `colossus`
is also necessary if you want to calculate the accretion redshift distribution for subhalos. You can install them quickly through
>   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy colossus
